Within GitHub get the URL of a specific SVG drawing by ...
   1) In the Tab "<> Code"  click on the file wanted
   2) In the file display click on "RAW"
   3) use the URL from the address line of your browser
   4) add "?sanitize=true" to the URL
   5) e.g. https://raw.github.com/dkracht/drawings/master/down.svg?sanitize=true
Within WordPress use that URL while editing a post and klicking on the button "Media File" ....
